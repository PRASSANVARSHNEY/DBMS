select name, nvl(name,'ok') from emp;
select name,nvl2 (name,'ok','not') from emp;


difference between nvl and nvl2 ?
in nvl if we have a null value in our table so if we want to replace our (null) word with nvl. like (nvl(name,'ok'))
in nvl if have to replace two or more records like (nvl2 (name,'ok','not')
